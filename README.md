# Strategy of implementation

We designed the user interface of our web application using Html,css and python.The first page of our website serves to provide the purpose of the website which is to search for a particular book with ease. Then we used openlibrary to import the dataset into the python program which is also to be the main programming language we used in our project. We imported flask module in order to link the html and python file. We created another html file to build the user interface of the second page of our website which enable the users to search for the book of their choice.
